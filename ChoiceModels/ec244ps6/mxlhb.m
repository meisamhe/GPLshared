% MODEL NOTATION
% Utility of person n from alternative j is: U_jn=F'Z_jn+C_n'X_jn+e_jn
% where F is a vector of fixed coefficients (the same for all people) of variables Z_jn. 
% and C_n is a vector of random coefficients (different for each person) of variables X_jn. 
% The random coefficients for each person are transformations of randomly distributed 
% latent terms. That is, C_n=T(B_n) for transformation T and B_n~N(A,D). 
% The transformations available in this code are:
%     normally distributed coefficient: C_n=B_n, 
%     lognormal: C_n=exp(B_n), 
%     truncated normal: C_n=max(0,B_n).
% The latent terms are distributed normally with mean vector A and covariance matrix D.
% Correlation among the latent terms induces correlation among the coefficients.
% The procedure takes draws of A, D, and B_n for all n sequentially using MCMC methods. 
% Draws of C_n are created from the draws of B_n. That is, a draw of B_n implies a draw of C_n.
% Matrix B={B_1,...,B_N} is a NVxNP matrix of latent terms for all people. 
% Matrix C is the corresponding matrix of coefficients for all people.

% Put a title for the run in the quotes below, to be printed at the top of the output file.

% DATA

% Number of people (decision-makers) in dataset 
NP=100;        

% Number of choice situations in dataset. This is the number faced by all the people combined.
NCS=1484;     

% Total number of alternatives faced by all people in all choice situations combined.
% This is the number of rows of data in XMAT below.
NROWS=1484.*3;

% Load and/or create XMAT, a matrix that contains the data.
%
% XMAT must contain one row of data for each alternative in each choice situation for each person.
% The rows are grouped by person, and by choice situations faced by each person.
% The number of rows in XMAT must be NROWS, specified above.
% The columns in XMAT are variable that describe the alternative.
% 
% The *first* column of XMAT identifies the person who faced this alternative. 
% The people must be numbered sequentially from 1 to NP, in ascending order.
% All alternatives for a given person must be grouped together.
% The *second* column of XMAT identifies the choice situation. The choice
% situations must be numbered sequentially from 1 to NCS.
% All alternatives for a given choice situation must be grouped together.
% The *third* column of XMAT identifies the chosen alternatives (1 for
% chosen, 0 for not). One and only one alternative must be chosen for each
% choice situation.
% The remaining columns of XMAT can be any variables.

XMAT=load('data.txt');  %The variables are described below
XMAT(:,4)=-XMAT(:,4)./10000;   %To scale price to be in tens of thousands of dollars.
XMAT(:,5)=-XMAT(:,5);

% To help you keep up with the variables, list the variables in XMAT here.
% Start each line with % so that matlab sees that it is a comment rather than a command.
% NOTES for XMAT for sample run:
% This dataset is for people's choice among vehicles in stated-preference
% experiments. Each person faced up to 15 experiments (some faced fewer
% than 15 because they did not complete all the experiments.) Each
% experiment contained 3 alternatives representing three different vehicles
% whose price and other attributes were described. The person stated which
% of the three vehicle he/she would buy if facing this choice in the real world.
% The variables in XMAT are:
% 1. Person number (1-NP)            MUST BE THIS. DO NOT CHANGE.
% 2. Choice situation number (1-NCS) MUST BE THIS. DO NOT CHANGE.
% 3. Chosen alternative (1/0)        MUST BE THIS. DO NOT CHANGE.
% 4. Price in tens of thousands of dollars 
% 5. Operating cost in dollars per month
% 6. Range in hundreds of miles (0 if not electric)
% 7. Electric (1/0)
% 8. Gas (1/0)
% 9. Hybrid (1/0)
% 10. High performance (1/0)
% 11. Medium or high performance (1/0)

% MODEL SPECIFICATION

% RANDOM COEFFICIENTS
% List the variables in XMAT that enter the model with random coefficients and
% give the distribution for the coefficient of each variable.
% IDV contains one row for each random coefficient and two columns.
% The *first* column gives the number of a variable in XMAT that has a random coefficient, 
% and the *second* column specifies the distribution of the coefficient for that variable.
% The distributions can be: 1. normal, 2. lognormal, 3. truncated normal (with the share 
% below zero massed at zero), 4. S_B, 5. normal with zero mean(for error components.)
% If no random coefficients, put IDV=[];
% Notes:
% The lognormal, truncated normal, and S_B distributions give positive
% coefficients only. If you want a variable to have only negative coefficients, 
% create the negative of the variable (in the specification of XMAT above).
% The S_B distribution gives coefficients between 0 and 1. If you want
% coefficients to be between 0 and k, then multiply the variable by k (in the specification 
% of XMAT above), since b*k*x for b~(0-1) is the same as b*x for b~(0-k).

% It is a column vector with the same length as IDV. For distribution 5 (normal with zero mean),
% put 0 for the starting value for the mean. The code will keep it at 0.
% B contains the random coefficients for each person.
% It is a matrix with IDV rows and NP columns.
% D contains the covariance matrix of the distribution of underlying normals for the 
% random coefficients. It is a symmetric matrix with IDV rows and columns.
% If FULLCV=0, then D is diagonal.
