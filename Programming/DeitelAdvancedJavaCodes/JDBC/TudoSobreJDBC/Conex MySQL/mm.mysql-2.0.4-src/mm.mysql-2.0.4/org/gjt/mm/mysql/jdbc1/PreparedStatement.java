 * A SQL Statement is pre-compiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object.

 * specify types that are compatible with the defined SQL type of the input
 * parameter.  For instance, if the IN parameter has SQL type Integer, then
 * setInt should be used.
 *
 * <p>If arbitrary parameter type conversions are required, then the setObject 
 * method should be used with a target SQL type.
