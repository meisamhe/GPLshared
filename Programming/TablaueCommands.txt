#============================================
Use visualization software to form & answer questions.
First steps:
? Step 1: Pick domain & data
? Step 2: Pose questions
? Step 3: Profile the data
? Iterate as needed
Create visualizations
? Interact with data
? Refine your questions
Make wiki notebook
? Keep record of your analysis
? Prepare a final graphic and caption

Specifying Table Configurations
#=======================
Operands are the database fields
? Each operand interpreted as a set {…}
? Quantitative and Ordinal fields treated differently
Three operators:
? concatenation (+)
? cross product (x)
? nest (/)

Table Algebra: Operands
#=======================
Ordinal fields: interpret domain as a set that partitions table into
rows and columns.
Quarter = {(Qtr1),(Qtr2),(Qtr3),(Qtr4)} ?

Quantitative fields: treat domain as single element set and
encode spatially as axes:
Profit = {(Profit[-410,650])} ?

Concatenation (+) Operator
#=======================
Ordered union of set interpretations
Quarter + Product Type
= {(Qtr1),(Qtr2),(Qtr3),(Qtr4)} + {(Coffee), (Espresso)}
= {(Qtr1),(Qtr2),(Qtr3),(Qtr4),(Coffee),(Espresso)}
Profit + Sales = {(Profit[-310,620]),(Sales[0,1000])}

Cross (x) Operator
#=======================
Cross-product of set interpretations
Quarter x Product Type
= {(Qtr1,Coffee), (Qtr1, Tea), (Qtr2, Coffee), (Qtr2, Tea), (Qtr3,
Coffee), (Qtr3, Tea), (Qtr4, Coffee), (Qtr4,Tea)}

Nest (/) Operator
#=======================
Cross-product filtered by existing records
Quarter x Month
creates twelve entries for each quarter. i.e.,
(Qtr1, December)
Quarter / Month
creates three entries per quarter based on

Table Algebra
#=====================================
The operators (+, x, /) and operands (O, Q)
provide an algebra for tabular visualization.
Algebraic statements are then mapped to:
Visualizations - trellis plot partitions, visual encodings
Queries - selection, projection, group-by aggregation
In Tableau, users make statements via drag-and-drop
Note that this specifies operands NOT operators!
Operators are inferred by data type (O, Q)

Visualizing Multiple Dimensions
#======================================
Strategies
• Start by visualizing individual dimensions
• Avoid “over-encoding”
• Use space and small multiples intelligently
• Use interaction to generate relevant views
There is rarely a single visualization that answers
all questions. Instead, the ability to generate
appropriate visualizations quickly is key.

Tableau Public tutorial
#===============================================
Before you start:
Download Tableau Public from: http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/download-steps
Create a Tableau Public account at: https://public.tableausoftware.com/auth/signup
Download the dataset from: http://www.peteraldhous.com/Data/USDA_activity_dataset.xls
The Data:
o Open USDA_activity_dataset.xls and examine the contents.
o The data details physical activity, obesity, and other health data in nearly 100 columns,
for more than 3000 rows, one for each county in the US.
Connect to the data:
o Drag and drop USDA_activity_dataset.xls on top of the Tableau Public icon on your
desktop to open.
o At the dialog box, click OK to connect.
o Tableau automatically recognizes categorical fields, like “State,” and numerical
measures like “Adult obesity rate.”
Create the first view (a map for each state showing obesity rates at the county level):
o Double click on “State” and “County.” Tableau Public recognizes they are geographical
fields and geocodes them accordingly.
o You may get a warning message; if so, check so that you don’t see it again.
o Notice there is a point at 0 degrees latitude and longitude. These are null values. Select
them by clicking to one side of the point, keep the mouse button depressed to draw a
rectangle over it, then release. Right click on the selected null values and select Exclude.
o Right click on the Exclusions in Filter and select Make Global, so that this will apply to all
subsequent views.
o Now you have a map showing a dot for every county where you have a record:o Drag “Adult obesity rate” from the Measures panel into Color, and copy it into Size
shelf to encode counties by those values.
o Change the Color to Red–White-Green Diverging, and reverse it:
o Now add a filter to enable the selection of individual states. Click and drag “State” into
the Filters shelf, click OK at the dialog box.
o Right click on “State” in the Filters shelf and select Show Quick Filter. Deselect All and
then select Alabama.
o Rename the worksheet “Map View” by right clicking on the tab at the bottom.
o Finished state of first view:Add a second view (scatter plots showing the relationship between obesity and health-related
behaviors at the county level):
o Add new worksheet:
o Drag “Adult obesity rate” onto Rows and “% smokers,” “% eating few fruits and
vegetables” and “% who do not exercise” into Columns.
o Drag “County” and “State” into Level of Detail. Without this step, Tableau’s default
behavior is to sum the values across all the counties and states, which will give you a
single data point for each graph, and not the desired scatter plots.
o The view should now look like this:
o Change Color to purple, open the Drop down menu next to “Automatic” and select
Circle, then move the slider below to the left to increase transparency of the points.
o Select Analysis in the top menu and check Trend Lines.
o Rename the worksheet “Scatterplot View” by right clicking on the tab at the bottom.
o Finished state of second view:Create a Dashboard with both views:
o Add dashboard:
o Double click on each view to bring both out onto the dashboard. Right click on the State
filter, select Compact list.
o Right click on this filter again, and select Make Global. This will ensure that selecting a
state alters both views simultaneously.
o Right click on this filter for a third time, select Customize and uncheck Show “All” Value.
This prevents users from seeing the entire data for all the US.
o Right click on the titles of each view and select Hide Title.
o Rename the dashboard “Obesity by state and county” by right clicking on the tab at the
bottom.
o Double click on Title under Objects
o The dashboard should now look like this:Save to the web:
o Under Size, click Edit and select the size and layout best for your website.
o Click File on the top menu and select Save to Web. You will be asked for your account login
at this point.
Embed on your website/blog:
o In the Save To Web Results window that has opened up, scroll down beneath the
visualization and click on Share.
o Copy and paste the embed code into the html of your web page.
o You should now have this online visualization:
