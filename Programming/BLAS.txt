Linear Algebra software
The BLAS
The Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines are extensively used in LAPACK, in other linear algebra packages, and elsewhere.

There are three levels of BLAS:

Level 1: Scalar and vector operations
Level 2: Matrix-vector operations
Level 3: Matrix-matrix operations
For general information about BLAS see http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html.

Optimized versions of the BLAS are available for many computer architectures. See

OpenBLAS
GotoBLAS

To install BLAS and LAPACK to work with gfortran, see:

http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GfortranBuild
On some linux systems, including the VM for the class, you can install both BLAS and LAPACK via:

$ sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
Direct methods for sparse systems
Although iterative methods are often used for sparse systems, there are also excellent software packages for direct methods (such as Gaussian elimination):

UMFPACK
SuperLU
MUMPS
Pardiso
