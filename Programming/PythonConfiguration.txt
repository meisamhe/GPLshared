Install OpenCV-Python in Windows
 
Goals
In this tutorial
* We will learn to setup OpenCV-Python in your Windows system.
Below steps are tested in a Windows 7-64 bit machine with Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012. The screenshots shows VS2012.
Installing OpenCV from prebuilt binaries
* Below Python packages are to be downloaded and installed to their default locations.
1.1. Python-2.7.x.
1.2. Numpy.
1.3. Matplotlib (Matplotlib is optional, but recommended since we use it a lot in our tutorials).
* Install all packages into their default locations. Python will be installed to C:/Python27/.
* After installation, open Python IDLE. Enter import numpy and make sure Numpy is working fine.
4. Download latest OpenCV release from sourceforge site and double-click to extract it.
5. Goto opencv/build/python/2.7 folder.
6. Copy cv2.pyd to C:/Python27/lib/site-packeges.
7. Open Python IDLE and type following codes in Python terminal.
>>> import cv2
>>> print cv2.__version__
If the results are printed out without any errors, congratulations !!! You have installed OpenCV-Python successfully.
Building OpenCV from source
1. Download and install Visual Studio and CMake.
1.1. Visual Studio 2012
1.2. CMake
2. Download and install necessary Python packages to their default locations
2.1. Python 2.7.x
2.2. Numpy
2.3. Matplotlib (Matplotlib is optional, but recommended since we use it a lot in our tutorials.)
Note
 
In this case, we are using 32-bit binaries of Python packages. But if you want to use OpenCV for x64, 64-bit binaries of Python packages are to be installed. Problem is that, there is no official 64-bit binaries of Numpy. You have to build it on your own. For that, you have to use the same compiler used to build Python. When you start Python IDLE, it shows the compiler details. You can get more information here. So your system must have the same Visual Studio version and build Numpy from source.
Note
 
Another method to have 64-bit Python packages is to use ready-made Python distributions from third-parties like Anaconda, Enthought etc. It will be bigger in size, but will have everything you need. Everything in a single shell. You can also download 32-bit versions also.
1. Make sure Python and Numpy are working fine.
2. Download OpenCV source. It can be from Sourceforge (for official release version) or from Github (for latest source).
3. Extract it to a folder, opencv and create a new folder build in it.
4. Open CMake-gui (Start > All Programs > CMake-gui)
5. Fill the fields as follows (see the image below):
7.1. Click on Browse Source... and locate the opencv folder.
7.2. Click on Browse Build... and locate the build folder we created.
7.3. Click on Configure.
7.4. It will open a new window to select the compiler. Choose appropriate compiler (here, Visual Studio 11) and click Finish.
7.5. Wait until analysis is finished.
6. You will see all the fields are marked in red. Click on the WITH field to expand it. It decides what extra features you need. So mark appropriate fields. See the below image:
7. Now click on BUILD field to expand it. First few fields configure the build method. See the below image:
8. Remaining fields specify what modules are to be built. Since GPU modules are not yet supported by OpenCV-Python, you can completely avoid it to save time (But if you work with them, keep it there). See the image below:
9. Now click on ENABLE field to expand it. Make sure ENABLE_SOLUTION_FOLDERS is unchecked (Solution folders are not supported by Visual Studio Express edition). See the image below:
10. Also make sure that in the PYTHON field, everything is filled. (Ignore PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARY). See image below:
11. Finally click the Generate button.
12. Now go to our opencv/build folder. There you will find OpenCV.sln file. Open it with Visual Studio.
13. Check build mode as Release instead of Debug.
14. In the solution explorer, right-click on the Solution (or ALL_BUILD) and build it. It will take some time to finish.
15. Again, right-click on INSTALL and build it. Now OpenCV-Python will be installed.
16. Open Python IDLE and enter import cv2. If no error, it is installed correctly.
Note
 
We have installed with no other support like TBB, Eigen, Qt, Documentation etc. It would be difficult to explain it here. A more detailed video will be added soon or you can just hack around.

 have this issue where I try to import cv2 on python and get the following error message.
>>> import cv2
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
I do understand there are many posts about this where it is suggested that the bitness of the package is different from the python package.
However, everything I am running is 64 bits. I am on win7 64 bits, I have the winpython 2.7.3.3, 64 bits distribution, and I compiled opencv in 64 bits with the instruction provided here and placed the cv2.pyd dll in the Lib/site-packages folder of python.
Unfortunately the suggestion of using the 32 bits version of python isn't working for me anymore as I have to handle numpy arrays too large for 32 bits.
Thanks!!!
------ UPDATE
The only thing missing was to add the new opencv binaries path (C:\opencv\build\bin\Release) to the Windows PATH environment variable, restart python.
Everything seems to be working fine now!

How do I interact with files in python?
Python comes with libraries that allow your programs to interact with files in your computer. This document covers part of the os module.
File Systems
Your computer drive is organized in a hierarchical structure of files and directories.
* files -- These contain information. Examples include be csv files, or python files.
* directories -- These contain files and directories inside of them
Your filesystem starts from a root directory, notated by a forward slash / on Unux and by a drive letter C:/ on Windows.
Absolute and Relative file paths
Absolute file paths are notated by a leading forward slash or drive label. For example, /home/example_user/example_directory or C:/system32/cmd.exe. An absolute file path describes how to access a given file or directory, starting from the root of the file system. A file path is also called a pathname.
Relative file paths are notated by a lack of a leading forward slash. For example, example_directory. A relative file path is interpreted from the perspective your current working directory. If you use a relative file path from the wrong directory, then the path will refer to a different file than you intend, or it will refer to no file at all.
In a sense, whenever you use a relative file path, it is joined with your current directory to create an absolute file path. That is, if my current working directory is /home/example_user and I use a relative file path of example_directory/example_python_program, then that is equivalent to using tho absolute file path /home/example_user/example_directory/example_file_program.
In the following example usage of a Unix command-line shell, the current working directory is initially /home/example_user/example_directory. There is a program called example_python_program, which prints "this is an example python program". At first, the program can be referenced by the relative file path example_python_program. After the directory is changed to /home/example_user, the relative file path to access the program becomes example_directory/example_python_program. Please note that the $ symbolizes a prompt where the user is allowed to type.
$ pwd
/home/example_user/example_directory
$ ls
example_python_program.py
$ python example_python_program.py
this is an example python program
$ example_directory  cd ..
$ pwd
/home/example_user
$ python example_python_program.py
python: can't open file 'example_python_program.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
$ python example_directory/example_python_program.py
this is an example python program
os.getcwd
When you run a python program, its current working directory is initialized to whatever your current working directory was when you ran the program. It can be retrieved using the function os.getcwd. Consider the following program, cwd_printer.py.
import os
print "The current working directory is", os.getcwd()
The following example usage of the command-line shell illustrates how Python's current working directory is set.
$ pwd
/home/example_user/example_directory
$ ls
cwd_printer.py
$ python cwd_printer.py
The current working directory is /home/example_user/example_directory
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/example_user
$ python example_directory/cwd_printer.py
The current working directory is /home/example_user
os.listdir and os.path.join
The os.listdir function takes one argument: an absolute or relative pathname, which should refer to a directory. The function returns a list of relative pathnames (strings) of all files/directories inside of the given directory name.
These strings should be used relative to os.listdir's argument. Consider the following situation:
* The current working directory is /home/example_user.
* There is a directory inside of /home/example_user called data. That is, this folder's absolute path is /home/example_user/data, and its relative path is data
* Inside of data is a file called people.txt.
The following example usage shows a wrong and a right way to open people.txt
$ pwd
/home/example_user
$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2012, 21:51:14) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import os
>>> filenames = os.listdir("data")
>>> filenames
['people.txt']
>>> file = open(filenames[0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'people.txt'
>>> pathname = os.path.join("data", filenames[0])
>>> pathname
'data/people.txt'
>>> open(pathname)
<open file 'data/people.txt', mode 'r' at 0x7f74ad5d8270>
>>>
Notice that when the first attempt to open the file was made, python reported that no file exists. Consider that we are trying to open the file with the absolute path of /home/example_user/data/people.txt. When we try to use the relative path of people.txt (recall that this is interpreted as relative because it does not have a leading /), our computer will combine the relative path with the current working directory, which in this case is/home/example_user. This generates the incorrect absolute path of /home/example_user/people.txt
Instead, we can combine data and people.txt using os.path.join to generate the relative path data/people.txt. When we try to use this new relative path, our computer generates the absolute path/home/example_user/data/people.txt, which is what we want.
Do not combine paths using string concatenation (+) or anything other than os.path.join. Different computers represent paths in different ways. In particular, Windows uses \ as a directory separator in pathnames, while Unix (Mac and Linux) machines use / as a directory separator in pathnames. Your code will not handle pathnames as elegantly and correctly as os.path.join will.

Getting Started with Videos
Goal
* Learn to read video, display video and save video.
* Learn to capture from Camera and display it.
* You will learn these functions : cv2.VideoCapture(), cv2.VideoWriter()
Capture Video from Camera
Often, we have to capture live stream with camera. OpenCV provides a very simple interface to this. Let’s capture a video from the camera (I am using the in-built webcam of my laptop), convert it into grayscale video and display it. Just a simple task to get started.
To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. Device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, don’t forget to release the capture.
import numpy as np
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while(True):
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()
# Our operations on the frame come here
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
# Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow('frame',gray)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
# When everything done, release the capture
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
cap.read() returns a bool (True/False). If frame is read correctly, it will be True. So you can check end of the video by checking this return value.
Sometimes, cap may not have initialized the capture. In that case, this code shows error. You can check whether it is initialized or not by the method cap.isOpened(). If it is True, OK. Otherwise open it using cap.open().
You can also access some of the features of this video using cap.get(propId) method where propId is a number from 0 to 18. Each number denotes a property of the video (if it is applicable to that video) and full details can be seen here: Property Identifier. Some of these values can be modified usingcap.set(propId, value). Value is the new value you want.
For example, I can check the frame width and height by cap.get(3) and cap.get(4). It gives me 640x480 by default. But I want to modify it to 320x240. Just use ret = cap.set(3,320) andret = cap.set(4,240).
Note
If you are getting error, make sure camera is working fine using any other camera application (like Cheese in Linux).
Playing Video from file
It is same as capturing from Camera, just change camera index with video file name. Also while displaying the frame, use appropriate time for cv2.waitKey(). If it is too less, video will be very fast and if it is too high, video will be slow (Well, that is how you can display videos in slow motion). 25 milliseconds will be OK in normal cases.
import numpy as np
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('vtest.avi')
while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
cv2.imshow('frame',gray)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Note
Make sure proper versions of ffmpeg or gstreamer is installed. Sometimes, it is a headache to work with Video Capture mostly due to wrong installation of ffmpeg/gstreamer.
Saving a Video
So we capture a video, process it frame-by-frame and we want to save that video. For images, it is very simple, just use cv2.imwrite(). Here a little more work is required.
This time we create a VideoWriter object. We should specify the output file name (eg: output.avi). Then we should specify the FourCC code (details in next paragraph). Then number of frames per second (fps) and frame size should be passed. And last one is isColor flag. If it is True, encoder expect color frame, otherwise it works with grayscale frame.
FourCC is a 4-byte code used to specify the video codec. The list of available codes can be found infourcc.org. It is platform dependent. Following codecs works fine for me.
* In Fedora: DIVX, XVID, MJPG, X264, WMV1, WMV2. (XVID is more preferable. MJPG results in high size video. X264 gives very small size video)
* In Windows: DIVX (More to be tested and added)
* In OSX : (I don’t have access to OSX. Can some one fill this?)
FourCC code is passed as cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G') orcv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG) for MJPG.
Below code capture from a Camera, flip every frame in vertical direction and saves it.
import numpy as np
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
# Define the codec and create VideoWriter object
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.avi',fourcc, 20.0, (640,480))
while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret==True:
        frame = cv2.flip(frame,0)
# write the flipped frame
        out.write(frame)
cv2.imshow('frame',frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        break
# Release everything if job is finished
cap.release()
out.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This article was written by Sergio Tapia Gutierrez. If you're after another opinion by Jason Fruit, checkout our other IDE article Comparison of Python IDEs for Development. We also have a Review of Python's Best Text Editors.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is one of the best tools a programmer can wield. It allows developers to work efficiently and forget about the boilerplate.
While some programmers scoff at the idea of using anything more than a text editor, when you are working on a very big project consisting of many files, an IDE will have features that will make your life as a developer much easier.
Some features you can expect a good IDE to have are:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Templates for common code
* Source Control support (eg. Subversion, Mercurial or Git)
Let's see which Python IDE's are the best and how they stack up against each other.

Converting Image to Grayscale with Python + OpenCV
Posted: September 23, 2012 in Python 
Tags: convert image to grayscale, opencv, python, tutorial

Hey guys, been reading OpenCV for python and thought of posting a tutorial on Programming a Grayscale Image Convertor. I encourage you to google them , there are lots and lots of examples and code snippets. This is on how to a convert any image to gray scale using Python and OpenCV.
A sample input image and output image are shown below (YEah, I am big Iron Man Fan! :B). You can click on image to enlarge:

I have placed an image named “ironman.png” in the current working directory (i.e. I have the original image in the same directory as the  place where I have saved my Python code).
First we import the cv2 module:
1import cv2Then ,read the image to a variable named “image” :
1image = cv2.imread('ironman.png')Now, to convert to gray-scale image and store it to another variable named “gray_image” use the functioncv2.cvtColor() with parameters as  the “image” variable and  “cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY” :
1gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)So, now the variable “gray_image” will hold the gray-scale version of the input image.
Now, to write/save the converted gray-scale image to the hard disk, we use the function “cv2.imwrite()” with parameters as “the name of converted image” and the variable “gray_image” to which the converted image was stored:
1cv2.imwrite('gray_image.png',gray_image)So, now if you open the directory where you saved your python code, you can see a new image there : gray_image.png! Wow! :D
Now, to display the original and the gray-scale ,we use function “cv2.imshow()” with parameters as the “window title” and the “image variable” :
1
2cv2.imshow('color_image',image)             
cv2.imshow('gray_image',gray_image) Complete Code for GrayScale Image convertor:

Python useful Scripts:
 
you can also do this:
section = "C_type"
new_section = "Sec_%s" % section
This allows you not only append, but also insert wherever in the string:
section = "C_type"
new_section = "Sec_%s_blah" % section

up vote10down voteacceptedObviously the file is too large to be read into memory all at once.
Why not just use:
with open("data.txt") as myfile:
    for line in myfile:
        do_something(line.rstrip("\n"))
or, if you're not on Python 2.6 and higher:
myfile = open("data.txt")
for line in myfile:
    do_something(line.rstrip("\n"))
In both cases, you'll get an iterator that can be treated much like a list of strings.
EDIT: Since your way of reading the entire file into one large string and then splitting it on newlines will remove the newlines in the process, I have added a .rstrip("\n") to my examples in order to better simulate the result. 
Pasted from <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2396238/memory-error-due-to-the-huge-input-file-size> 
 
Try the rstrip method.
>>> 'test string\n'.rstrip()
'test string'
Note that Python's rstrip method strips all kinds of whitespace by default, not just newlines as Perl does with chomp. To strip only newlines:
>>> 'test string \n'.rstrip('\n')
'test string '
There is also the lstrip and strip methods.
>>> s = " \n  abc   def   "
>>> s.strip()
'abc   def'
>>> s.rstrip()
' \n  abc   def'
>>> s.lstrip()
'abc   def   '

Reading and Writing Files in Python
Overview
In Python, you don't need to import any library to read and write files.
The first step is to get a file object.
The way to do this is to use the open function.
File Types
A file is usually categorized as either text or binary.
A text file is often structured as a sequence of lines and a line is a sequence
of characters.
The line is terminated by a EOL (End Of Line) character. 
The most common line terminator is the \n , or the newline character. 
The backslash character indicates that the next character will be treated as a
newline. 
A binary file is basically any file that is not a text file. Binary files can
only be processed by application that know about the file's structure.
Open ( )
To open a file for writing use the built-i open() function. open() returns a
file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments.
The syntax is:
file_object = open(filename, mode) where file_object is the variable to put the
file object.
The second argument describes the way in which the file will be used.
Mode
The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if it’s omitted.
The modes can be:
'r' when the file will only be read
'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased)
'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically
added to the end. 
'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.
>>> f = open('workfile', 'w')
>>> print f
Next the file objects functions can be called. The two most common functions are
read and write.
Create a text file
Let's first create a new text file. You can name it anything you like,
in this example we will name it "newfile.txt".
file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write("hello world in the new file\n")
file.write("and another line\n")
file.close()
If we now look in the newfile.txt, we can see the text that we wrote:
$ cat newfile.txt 
hello world in the new file
and another line
How to read a text file
To read a file, we can use different methods.
file.read( )
If you want to return a string containing all characters in the file, you can
use file.read().
file = open('newfile.txt', 'r')
print file.read()
Output:
hello world in the new file
and another line
We can also specify how many characters the string should return, by using
file.read(n), where "n" determines number of characters.
This reads the first 5 characters of data and returns it as a string.
file = open('newfile.txt', 'r')
print file.read(5)
Output:
hello
file.readline( )
The readline() function will read from a file line by line (rather than pulling
the entire file in at once).
Use readline() when you want to get the first line of the file, subsequent calls
to readline() will return successive lines.
Basically, it will read a single line from the file and return a string
containing characters up to \n.
file = open('newfile.txt', 'r')
print file.readline():
Output:
hello world in the new file
file.readlines( )
readlines() returns the complete ?le as a list of strings each separated by \n
file = open('newfile.txt', 'r')
print file.readlines()
Output:
['hello world in the new file\n', 'and another line\n']
Looping over a file object
For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. 
This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code.
file = open('newfile.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print line,
Output:
hello world in the new file
and another line
file.write( )
The write method takes one parameter, which is the string to be written. 
To start a new line after writing the data, add a \n character to the end.
file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write("This is a test\n")
file.write("And here is another line\n")
file.close()
Close ( )
When you’re done with a file, call f.close() to close it and free up any system
resources taken up by the open file. 
After calling f.close(), attempts to use the file object will automatically fail.
File Handling Usages
Let's show some example on how to use the different file methods
To open a text file, use:
fh = open("hello.txt", "r")
To read a text file, use:
fh = open("hello.txt","r")
print fh.read()
To read one line at a time, use:
fh = open("hello".txt", "r")
print fh.readline()
To read a list of lines use:
fh = open("hello.txt.", "r")
print fh.readlines()
To write to a file, use:
fh = open("hello.txt","w")
fh.write("Hello World")
fh.close()
To write to a file, use:
fh = open("hello.txt", "w")
lines_of_text = ["a line of text", "another line of text", "a third line"]
fh.writelines(lines_of_text)
fh.close()
To append to file, use:
fh = open("Hello.txt", "a")
fh.write("Hello World again")
fh.close
To close a file, use
fh = open("hello.txt", "r")
print fh.read()
fh.close()
With Statement
Another way of working with file objects is the With statement.
It is good practice to use this statement. 
With the "With" statement, you get better syntax and exceptions handling. 
In addition, it will automatically close the file. The with statement provides a
way for ensuring that a clean-up is always used.
Opening a file using with is as simple as:
with open(filename) as file:
Let's take a look at some examples
with open("newtext.txt") as file:        # Use file to refer to the file object
    data = file.read()
    do something with data
You can of course also loop over the file object:
with open("newfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print line,
Notice, that we didn't have to write "file.close()". That will automatically be
called.
With Examples
Let's show some examples on how we can use this in our every day programming.
Write to a file using With
Write to a file using the With statement
with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Hello World")
Read a file line by line into an list
This will read the file hello.txt and save the content into "data".
with open(hello.txt) as f:
    data = f.readlines()
Splitting Lines
As a last example, we will show how to split lines from a text file.
The split function in our example, splits the string contained in the variable
data, whenever it sees a space character. 
You can split by whatever you wish, line.split(":") would split the line using
colons.
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.readlines()
for line in data:
        words = line.split()
        print words
Output:
Because multiple values are returned by split, they are returned as an array.
['hello', 'world,', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'today?']
['today', 'is', 'saturday']

7. Input and Output
There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.
7.1. Fancier Output Formatting
So far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the print statement. (A third way is using the write() method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as sys.stdout. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)
Often you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated values. There are two ways to format your output; the first way is to do all the string handling yourself; using string slicing and concatenation operations you can create any layout you can imagine. The string types have some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width; these will be discussed shortly. The second way is to use thestr.format() method.
The string module contains a Template class which offers yet another way to substitute values into strings.
One question remains, of course: how do you convert values to strings? Luckily, Python has ways to convert any value to a string: pass it to the repr() or str()functions.
The str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while repr() is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a SyntaxError if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human consumption, str() will return the same value as repr(). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings and floating point numbers, in particular, have two distinct representations.
Some examples:
>>>
>>> s = 'Hello, world.'
>>> str(s)
'Hello, world.'
>>> repr(s)
"'Hello, world.'"
>>> str(1.0/7.0)
'0.142857142857'
>>> repr(1.0/7.0)
'0.14285714285714285'
>>> x = 10 * 3.25
>>> y = 200 * 200
>>> s = 'The value of x is ' + repr(x) + ', and y is ' + repr(y) + '...'
>>> print s
The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000...
>>> # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes:
... hello = 'hello, world\n'
>>> hellos = repr(hello)
>>> print hellos
'hello, world\n'
>>> # The argument to repr() may be any Python object:
... repr((x, y, ('spam', 'eggs')))
"(32.5, 40000, ('spam', 'eggs'))"
Here are two ways to write a table of squares and cubes:
>>>
>>> for x in range(1, 11):
...     print repr(x).rjust(2), repr(x*x).rjust(3),
...     # Note trailing comma on previous line
...     print repr(x*x*x).rjust(4)
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000
>>> for x in range(1,11):
...     print '{0:2d} {1:3d} {2:4d}'.format(x, x*x, x*x*x)
...
 1   1    1
 2   4    8
 3   9   27
 4  16   64
 5  25  125
 6  36  216
 7  49  343
 8  64  512
 9  81  729
10 100 1000
(Note that in the first example, one space between each column was added by the way print works: it always adds spaces between its arguments.)
This example demonstrates the str.rjust() method of string objects, which right-justifies a string in a field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods str.ljust() and str.center(). These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don’t truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that’s usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a slice operation, as in x.ljust(n)[:n].)
There is another method, str.zfill(), which pads a numeric string on the left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs:
>>>
>>> '12'.zfill(5)
'00012'
>>> '-3.14'.zfill(7)
'-003.14'
>>> '3.14159265359'.zfill(5)
'3.14159265359'
Basic usage of the str.format() method looks like this:
>>>
>>> print 'We are the {} who say "{}!"'.format('knights', 'Ni')
We are the knights who say "Ni!"
The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with the objects passed into the str.format() method. A number in the brackets refers to the position of the object passed into the str.format() method.
>>>
>>> print '{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs')
spam and eggs
>>> print '{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs')
eggs and spam
If keyword arguments are used in the str.format() method, their values are referred to by using the name of the argument.
>>>
>>> print 'This {food} is {adjective}.'.format(
...       food='spam', adjective='absolutely horrible')
This spam is absolutely horrible.
Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:
>>>
>>> print 'The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.'.format('Bill', 'Manfred',
...                                                    other='Georg')
The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.
'!s' (apply str()) and '!r' (apply repr()) can be used to convert the value before it is formatted.
>>>
>>> import math
>>> print 'The value of PI is approximately {}.'.format(math.pi)
The value of PI is approximately 3.14159265359.
>>> print 'The value of PI is approximately {!r}.'.format(math.pi)
The value of PI is approximately 3.141592653589793.
An optional ':' and format specifier can follow the field name. This allows greater control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds Pi to three places after the decimal.
>>>
>>> import math
>>> print 'The value of PI is approximately {0:.3f}.'.format(math.pi)
The value of PI is approximately 3.142.
Passing an integer after the ':' will cause that field to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making tables pretty.
>>>
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}
>>> for name, phone in table.items():
...     print '{0:10} ==> {1:10d}'.format(name, phone)
...
Jack       ==>       4098
Dcab       ==>       7678
Sjoerd     ==>       4127
If you have a really long format string that you don’t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets '[]' to access the keys
>>>
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print ('Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; '
...        'Dcab: {0[Dcab]:d}'.format(table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
This could also be done by passing the table as keyword arguments with the ‘**’ notation.
>>>
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print 'Jack: {Jack:d}; Sjoerd: {Sjoerd:d}; Dcab: {Dcab:d}'.format(**table)
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function vars(), which returns a dictionary containing all local variables.
For a complete overview of string formatting with str.format(), see Format String Syntax.
7.1.1. Old string formatting
The % operator can also be used for string formatting. It interprets the left argument much like a sprintf()-style format string to be applied to the right argument, and returns the string resulting from this formatting operation. For example:
>>>
>>> import math
>>> print 'The value of PI is approximately %5.3f.' % math.pi
The value of PI is approximately 3.142.
More information can be found in the String Formatting Operations section.
7.2. Reading and Writing Files
open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: open(filename, mode).
>>>
>>> f = open('workfile', 'w')
>>> print f
<open file 'workfile', mode 'w' at 80a0960>
The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read, 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; 'r'will be assumed if it’s omitted.
On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode, so there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb', and 'r+b'. Python on Windows makes a distinction between text and binary files; the end-of-line characters in text files are automatically altered slightly when data is read or written. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for ASCII text files, but it’ll corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files. On Unix, it doesn’t hurt to append a 'b' to the mode, so you can use it platform-independently for all binary files.
7.2.1. Methods of File Objects
The rest of the examples in this section will assume that a file object called f has already been created.
To read a file’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string. size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size bytes are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, f.read() will return an empty string ("").
>>>
>>> f.read()
'This is the entire file.\n'
>>> f.read()
''
f.readline() reads a single line from the file; a newline character (\n) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if f.readline() returns an empty string, the end of the file has been reached, while a blank line is represented by '\n', a string containing only a single newline.
>>>
>>> f.readline()
'This is the first line of the file.\n'
>>> f.readline()
'Second line of the file\n'
>>> f.readline()
''
For reading lines from a file, you can loop over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code:
>>>
>>> for line in f:
        print line,
This is the first line of the file.
Second line of the file
If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().
f.write(string) writes the contents of string to the file, returning None.
>>>
>>> f.write('This is a test\n')
To write something other than a string, it needs to be converted to a string first:
>>>
>>> value = ('the answer', 42)
>>> s = str(value)
>>> f.write(s)
f.tell() returns an integer giving the file object’s current position in the file, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file. To change the file object’s position, use f.seek(offset, from_what). The position is computed from adding offset to a reference point; the reference point is selected by the from_whatargument. A from_what value of 0 measures from the beginning of the file, 1 uses the current file position, and 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point.from_what can be omitted and defaults to 0, using the beginning of the file as the reference point.
>>>
>>> f = open('workfile', 'r+')
>>> f.write('0123456789abcdef')
>>> f.seek(5)     # Go to the 6th byte in the file
>>> f.read(1)
'5'
>>> f.seek(-3, 2) # Go to the 3rd byte before the end
>>> f.read(1)
'd'
When you’re done with a file, call f.close() to close it and free up any system resources taken up by the open file. After calling f.close(), attempts to use the file object will automatically fail.
>>>
>>> f.close()
>>> f.read()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ValueError: I/O operation on closed file
It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way. It is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks:
>>>
>>> with open('workfile', 'r') as f:
...     read_data = f.read()
>>> f.closed
True
File objects have some additional methods, such as isatty() and truncate() which are less frequently used; consult the Library Reference for a complete guide to file objects.
7.2.2. Saving structured data with json
Strings can easily be written to and read from a file. Numbers take a bit more effort, since the read() method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like int(), which takes a string like '123' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated.
Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called json can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a file or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.
Note
 
The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.
If you have an object x, you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code:
>>>
>>> json.dumps([1, 'simple', 'list'])
'[1, "simple", "list"]'
Another variant of the dumps() function, called dump(), simply serializes the object to a file. So if f is a file object opened for writing, we can do this:
json.dump(x, f)
To decode the object again, if f is a file object which has been opened for reading:
x = json.load(f)
This simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra effort. The reference for the json module contains an explanation of this.

pickle - the pickle module
Contrary to JSON, pickle is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.
