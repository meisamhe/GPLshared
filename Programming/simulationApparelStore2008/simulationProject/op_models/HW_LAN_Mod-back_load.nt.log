0	472	Atlanta.Router	Results	RIP	Performance	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  1. No RIP routing updates past a certain <NL>  simulation time. <NL>  2. Lower than expected throughput or <NL>  utilization of the links. <NL>   <NL> CAUSE(S): <NL>  "RIP Sim Efficiency" simulation attribute <NL>  is set to "Enabled". <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  If you are studying the effect of RIP routing <NL>  traffic or studying the effect of Link/Node <NL>  failures on a RIP network, Set "RIP Sim Efficiency" simulation attribute to "Disabled". <NL>  
5.18614565187	734	New_York.Office_LAN	Protocol	UDP	Packet Drop	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  Discarding UDP datagram received (destined <NL>  for port number: 520) <NL>   <NL>  It is typical for end nodes (e.g., wkstn <NL>  and servers) to discard datagrams containing <NL>  RIP messages (i.e., port 520) and LDP (Label  <NL>  Distribution Protocol, port 646) messages.   <NL>  In that case, this message can be ignored. <NL>   <NL> EFFECT(S): <NL>  1. The datagram is discarded by the UDP. <NL>  2. Application data may not be received. <NL>  3. No Effects if the datagram was received <NL>     for port 520 and node is not using RIP. <NL>  4. No Effects if the datagram was received <NL>     for port 646 and node is not MPLS enabled. <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  Make sure that the applications are <NL>  sending packets to a port that UDP <NL>  is listening on. <NL>   <NL>  This message will not be repeated. <NL>  
235	117287	Boston.Office_LAN	Protocol	TCP	Data_Transmission	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  TCP is retransmitting data segments <NL>  which will cause additional overhead <NL>  on the lower layers and links <NL>   <NL> CAUSE(S): <NL>  This may be normal behavior on a  <NL>  network which has either: <NL>  1) Slow links <NL>  2) Possibly dropped packets (ATM or FR) <NL>  3) Queuing delays <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  If any of the causes listed above are <NL>  expected, no action is required, as <NL>  this is normal protocol behavior for <NL>  TCP <NL>   <NL>  Otherwise look for problems in the <NL>  lower layers, such as IP dropped  <NL>  packets or other errors in the  <NL>  simulation log <NL>   <NL>  View TCP response time statistics <NL>  for data regarding the delays <NL>   <NL> This message will not be repeated <NL>  
2000	1230879	philadelphia.Router	Results	IP	Results	SUGGESTION(s): <NL> You might be able to improve the performance of this simulation <NL> by configuring the 'IP Source Dest Pairs' environment attribute <NL> as described below. Note that the value of this attribute will <NL> not affect the results of the simulation. <NL>   <NL> The IP forwarding mechanism can be tuned to maintain peak <NL> performance while simulating large IP networks. The trade off is <NL> that higher values of this attribute will require more memory. <NL> The optimal value can be calculated as the maximum number of <NL> unique IP source destination pairs that will pass through any <NL> IP routing node in the network. <NL>   <NL> The first value given below is the value used for this <NL> simulation. It was either configured explicitly through the <NL> environment attribute or estimated before the simulation based <NL> on various parameters such as the number of nodes and demands. <NL> The recommended value given is a more accurate estimate computed <NL> after the simulation. <NL>   <NL> Estimated/Configured value: 7 <NL> Recommended value: 10 <NL>   <NL> ACTION(s): <NL> 1. If the estimated value and optimal values are close or if <NL>    performace is not a critical issue for this simulation, <NL>    this message may be ignored. <NL> 2. If the above values are significantly different from each <NL>    other and simulation performance is important, set the value <NL>    of the environment attribute `IP Source Dest Pairs' through an <NL>    environment (.ef) file. Please refer the product documentation <NL>    for more information on environment files and how to use them. <NL> 3. This attribute does not have to be set to the optimal value <NL>    suggested above. Setting this attribute to a higher value might <NL>    increase simulation performance with the trade off that memory <NL>    usage will also increase. Similarly, a lower value may be used <NL>    to decrease memory usage by sacrificing performance. <NL> 4. To disable the printing of this log message set the boolean <NL>    environment attribute 'IP Source Dest Pairs Log' to 'disabled' <NL>
