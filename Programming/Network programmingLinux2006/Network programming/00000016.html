<a href="mailto:arouse@austin.ibm.com">Allen Rouse</a>
asks <i>" What books are there that deal exclusively with the issues of 
writing
servers? For example, Richard Stevens' books deal with the tools needed
to write any kind of UNIX software, servers are just one among many. He
mentions general TYPES of servers but not much about the specific issues
encountered in writing complex servers (like say NetTrek or an ORB)."</i>

<p>
<b>Stallman is the starting point</b><br>
Specifically, the book series<br>
<b>"Unix Network Programming"</b> 

is a very very good place to start. Currently, only the 1st volume of 
the series is available, but it is offers a very in depth view of what 
to do to write a server (and clients, etc) and why. Unfortunately, 
Stallman has a nasty tendancy to make you read through his entire book 
to understand a more advanced concept, so you can't just 'flip' to a later 
topic and pick up there without at least some going back of chapters to see 
how he explains things... even if you already have an idea of what he's 
trying to say.</p><p>

If you're like me, you probably want to immediately leap into an operational 
code situation right away. There's a number of FAQs online about quick 'n 
dirty client server, but a suprisingly straightfoward c-s demonstration 
is available in the Perl manual, by typing <b>man perlipc</b>. That's where 
I got my start.

</p><p><br>
<b>Server?</b>
<br>
Hmm... well, it depends on what you want to serve.  And how you want to 
transmit information.  You can write "server" shell scripts, and run them 
from inetd, and they will use their standard in/standard out.  A simple web 
"server", for instance, could be
</p><p>
<tt>
#!/bin/sh
<br>
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
<br>
echo Content-type text/html
<br>
echo
<br>
echo
'&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello,
World! You said:'"`cat`"'&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'
<br>
</tt>
</p><p>
run from port 80.
</p><p>
Now, if you want a daemon, I don't remember... you have to fork, cut off 
stdin/out/err, and do a couple of other things...
</p><p>
Also, remember that this server should be secure.  Keep away from possible 
buffer overruns.  Stuff like that.

<br>
</p><p>
<b>Secure programming hints</b>
<br>
For servers, it's important to start thinking in terms of security as early
as possible.
</p><p>
Here are some nice resources I've found that deal with secure programming:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sunworld.com/swol-04-1998/swol-04-security.html">Designing secure software</a>
</li><li><a href="http://olympus.cs.ucdavis.edu/%7Ebishop/secprog.html">Writing Safe Setuid Programs</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.homeport.org/%7Eadam/review.html">Security Code Review Guidelines</a>
</li><li><a href="ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/papers/secure_programming_checklist">secure programming checklist</a>

<br>
<b>Perl? Try NetServer::Generic</b><br>
<br>Just a quick plug for NetServer::Generic, a perl
module intended to make writing TCP/IP servers
easy.
</p><p>
Version 0.2 should show up on CPAN in a week or
so (when I finish jumping up and down on it and
write some installation tests and documentation).

</p><p>
<br>
<b>Entire Book on writing servers is overkill!</b><br>

<br>While it certainly doesn't seem that way <br>initially, it's a very steep 
learning curve<br>which becomes almost horizontal after the first<br>few feet.
(insert other annoying analogies at<br>your leisure).<br><br>Servers require 
a several page magazine article<br>at best (The Linux Journal had one in 
fact :)<br><br>Things you must learn, not entirely server<br>related, but 
the sum of these make whole:<br><br>* Sockets. Without sockets, you may as 
well not<br>have a computer. You can find a fairly neat <br>sockets 
programming tutorial at <br>http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~beej/guide/net<br>
VERY useful.<br><br>* UNIX programming. (duh). Seriously, 
UNIX<br>programming is more than just knowing C. UNIX<br>programming manuals 
will help with this quite<br>wonderfully (obviously :).<br><br>* 
Forking/Threading. You DO want your server to<br>handle more than one 
connection at a time, don't<br>you? Forking is part of UNIX programming 
lore, but<br>threading is newer, less-standardized, and <br>trickier.<br><br>* 
RFC. The Sacred RFC's define much of our lives.<br>If you're looking to write 
a server, search an<br>RFC Index for the server in question, download 
the<br>RFC, and assimilate it. They're rather cryptic<br>and sterile in 
nature, but you get used to it<br>after you read a hundred or so. 
:)<br><br>Probably the coolest way of writing a server if<br>you don't want 
to sweat all of the sockets/forking<br>details is by making use of inetd. 
(man inetd).<br><br>inetd can basically let IDIOTS (no offense :) <br>write 
functional servers. (man inetd.conf)<br>Basically this happens:<br><br>When 
something connects to your system, inetd<br>will see if it has a servlet to 
handle it, if it<br>does, it starts the servlet and sends whatever 
it<br>recieves on a socket to the servlet's standard<br>input, and whatever 
the servlet writes to standard<br>output is sent to the remote client over 
the<br>network. Neat huh?<br><br>As for complex servers, really complicated 
servers<br>are just simple servers with complicated features.<br>(I can 
probably say dumber things today, wait)<br><br>There's really not much to 
learn. Now the data<br>you want to send back to a client that connects<br>to 
your server is a different story, but it<br>itself isn't much a server thing 
at all. :)<br><br>

</p><p><br>
<b>Use the source</b><br>


If you want to know how to write a server, find a package that you think 
was written around similar principles as what you expect yours to be like, 
and which you like to use, and start examining what was done in that 
program, and why.</p><p>

If you want a fast and secure network server, look at the design of qmail, 
and ask about the design choices on the qmail list.  If you want to know 
more about something like a MUSH, then find your favorite mush server, 
and talk to the folks who wrote the server, and those who designed 
the world.  Etc., etc.</p><p>

It's also very instructional to find out what specific changes were made 
in different versions of the same program, or in competing programs.</p><p>

<b>Re: Writing a server?</b><br>
I would suggest UNIX Distributed Programming by Chris Brown.<br><br>
Prentice Hall Press; ISBN: 0130758965<br><br>This is a well written book 
with tons of working code.  It will definitely get you going in the 
right direction.

<br></p><p>
<b>reference for writing a (web) server</b><br>

If you are interested in writing a Web server or<br>an application that uses 
the HTTP protocols), <br>have a look at the book "Illustrated Guide to HTTP" 
by Paul Hethmon.  Unfortunately he doesn't<br>use Unix/Linux (although the 
code examples are<br>written in C/C++) but the book does cover how to<br>use 
the HTTP/1.1 protocols.  Then you could<br>have a look at Apache and 
Jigsaw to see how<br>they are implemented.

<br></p><p>
<b>Internetworking w/ TCP/IP Vol III</b><br>
THE book you are looking for is Internetworking w/ TCP/IP Vol. III.  by 
Comer and Stevens.  (2nd edition).  It has everything you'll need to 
develop clients and servers for BSD socket based systems.  Here is a short 
chapter listing:
</p><p>

<br>
2.  The Client Server Model and Software Design
<br>
3.  Concurrent Processing in Client-Server Software
<br>
4.  Program Interface to Protocols
<br>
5.  The Socket Interface
<br>
6.  Algorithms and Issues in Client Software Design
<br>
7.  Example Client Software
<br>
8.  Algorithms and Issues in Server Software Design
<br>
9.  Iterative, Connectionless Servers (UDP)
<br>
10.  Iterative, Connection-Oriented Servers (TCP)
<br>
11.  Concurrent, Connection-Oriented Servers(TCP)
<br>
12.  Single-Process, Concurrent Servers (TCP)
<br>
13.  Multiprotocol Servers (TCP, UDP)
<br>
14.  Multiservice Servers (TCP,UDP)
<br>
15.  Uniform, Effiecient Management of Server Concurrency
<br>

</p><p>

Ugh, there are 8 more chapters.. but you get the idea.  Lots of GREAT examples,
easy to understand.  I use this book all the time.

<b>OO Framework for building communication SW...</b><br>
See http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html<br><br>Here's for those who 
won't make it to the web site : <br>Overview of ACE<br><br>The ADAPTIVE 
Communication Environment (ACE) is an object-oriented (OO) framework that 
implements many core<br>design patterns for concurrent communication 
software. ACE provides a rich set of reusable C++ wrappers and<br>framework 
components that perform common communication software tasks across a range 
of OS platforms. The<br>communication software tasks provided by ACE 
include event demultiplexing and event handler dispatching, signal<br>handling,
service initialization, interprocess communication, shared memory management, 
message routing, dynamic<br>(re)configuration of distributed services, 
concurrent execution and synchronization. <br><br>ACE is targeted for 
developers of high-performance and real-time communication services and 
applications. It<br>simplifies the development of OO network applications 
and services that utilize interprocess communication, event<br>demultiplexing, 
explicit dynamic linking, and concurrency. In addition, ACE automates system 
configuration and<br>reconfiguration by dynamically linking services into 
applications at run-time and executing these services in one or<br>more 
processes or threads. <br><br>ACE has been ported and tested on a wide range 
of OS platforms including Win32 (i.e., WinNT 3.5.x, 4.x, Win95, and<br>WinCE 
using MSVC++ and Borland C++ on Intel and Alpha platforms), most versions of 
UNIX (e.g., Solaris 1.x and 2.x on<br>SPARC and Intel, SGI IRIX 5.x and 6.x, 
DG/UX, HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, and 11.x, DEC UNIX 3.x and 4.x, AIX 3.x and 4.x, 
DG/UX,<br>UnixWare, SCO, and freely available UNIX implementations like Linux, 
FreeBSD, and NetBSD), real-time operating<br>systems (e.g., LynxOS, VxWorks, 
and PSoS), and MVS OpenEdition. A single source tree is used for all these 
platforms.<br>There is also a Java version of ACE.
