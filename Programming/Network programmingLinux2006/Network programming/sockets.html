<h1>A Brief Socket Tutorial</h1>

<p>
This page gives some examples and explanation of simple programs
performing TCP communication using sockets, in
<a href="#cpp-sockets">C++</a> and
<a href="#java-sockets">Java</a>.  You may
copy this code and modify it to your purposes.
</p>

<h2 id="cpp-sockets">C++</h2>

<p>
Socket programming in C++ tends to be somewhat system dependent,
unfortunately.  The examples here work on Whitebox Linux, and would
probably work on other Linuxes, and maybe even on other Unixes.
For Windows help, try the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/winsock_reference.asp">
Winsock Reference</a> page.  For the rest of this section I'll
assume you're using Unix, but the API in Windows is quite similar so
this should be helpful for Windows users too.
</p>

<p>
Here are sample programs - client/server pairs for TCP and UDP.  In
these programs, the client prompts the user for a line of text and
sends it to the server, which converts the line to upper case and
sends it back.

<li><a href="http://sage.mc.yu.edu/kbeen/teaching/networking/resources/tcp-client.cc">tcp-client.cc</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sage.mc.yu.edu/kbeen/teaching/networking/resources/udp-server.cc">udp-server.cc</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sage.mc.yu.edu/kbeen/teaching/networking/resources/udp-client.cc">udp-client.cc</a></li>
</ul>
Below are descriptions of the steps taken by the TCP programs; the UDP
programs are similar.


<p>
To compile the TCP server, for example, do
</p><pre>g++ -o tcp-server tcp-server.cc
</pre>
This will put the executable in the file <code>tcp-server</code>. If
you want to call it something else, use <code>-o foo</code>, or
whatever, instead of <code>-o tcp-server</code>.


<p>
There are comments in the source that explain a lot of it, in addition
to the explanations on this page.  Keep in mind that you do not need to
understand every detail to use this code.  There are some details that
I still do not understand.  But so long as you get the main idea of
what is going on, you can just copy the more obscure details as they
appear in these examples.
</p>

<h3>Utility Routines</h3>

<p>
Here is a description of some utility routines that are used a lot in
the C++ code.
</p><ul class="spaced">
<li>
<code>htonl()</code> and <code>htons()</code>: Convert long integer and
short integer (respectively) from host byte order (on x86 this is
Least Significant Byte First) to standard network byte order (Most
Significant Byte First).
</li>

<li>
<code>ntohl()</code> and <code>ntohs()</code>: The opposite of
<code>htonl()</code> and <code>htons()</code> (see above); i.e., convert
network byte order to host byte order.
</li>

<li>
<code>inet_ntoa()</code>:  Converts an IP address from binary form to
the <q>numbers and dots</q> notation.
</li>

<li>
<code>gethostbyname()</code>:  Takes an IP address in <q>numbers and
dots</q> notation, and returns a structure with various pieces of
information.  It's not really necessary to know what that structure is
all about, just that it's needed when making the socket connection.
</li>

<li>
<code>memset()</code> is not specific to sockets, but you might not
have seen it before.  It is defined in <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>,
and it is just an efficient way to set all elements of an array to a
given value.
</li>

</ul>


<h3>The TCP Server</h3>

<p>
The TCP server goes through five (or six) main steps, as regards the socket.
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>
Create a socket, using the <code>socket()</code> function call:
</p><pre>  listenSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (listenSocket &lt; 0) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "cannot create listen socket";
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
<code>SOCK_STREAM</code> is a constant that indicates this will be a
TCP (reliable) connection; use <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> for
(unreliable) UDP communication.  Don't worry about the other
parameters; they never change. 

</li>

<li>
<p>
Bind the socket to the port that clients will connect to:
</p><pre>  serverAddress.sin_family = AF_INET;
  serverAddress.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
  serverAddress.sin_port = htons(listenPort);
  
  if (bind(listenSocket,
           (struct sockaddr *) &amp;serverAddress,
           sizeof(serverAddress)) &lt; 0) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "cannot bind socket";
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
Don't worry about understanding all that serverAddress stuff.  Just
notice that <code>listenPort</code> is a variable with the port
number.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Wait for clients:
</p><pre>  listen(listenSocket, 5);
</pre>
The second parameter is the <q>backlog</q>, or <q>the maximum length
the queue of pending connections may grow to</q>, according to the
Linux man page.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Establish a connection with a client that requests one, using the
<code>accept()</code> function call:
</p><pre>    clientAddressLength = sizeof(clientAddress);
    connectSocket = accept(listenSocket,
                           (struct sockaddr *) &amp;clientAddress,
                           &amp;clientAddressLength);
    if (connectSocket &lt; 0) {
      cerr &lt;&lt; "cannot accept connection ";
      exit(1);
    }
</pre>
This creates a <em>new</em> socket, which is used for this particular
connection.  The 
original socket may continue accepting more connections, and
establishing new sockets for them, while this connection is still
active.  (But that would probably require the program to be
multi-threaded....)  Multiple sockets open on the same port will be
distinguished by being connected to different (ip address, port)
combinations on the client side.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Read and write over the socket using the <code>recv()</code> and
<code>send()</code> functions, respectively.  Here is the whole
read/write loop from the sample program:
</p><pre>    memset(line, 0x0, LINE_ARRAY_SIZE);
    while (recv(connectSocket, line, MAX_MSG, 0) &gt; 0) {
      cout &lt;&lt; "  --  " &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; "\n";

      // Convert line to upper case.
      for (i = 0; line[i] != '\0'; i++)
        line[i] = toupper(line[i]);

      // Send converted line back to client.
      if (send(connectSocket, line, strlen(line) + 1, 0) &lt; 0)
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: cannot send modified data";

      memset(line, 0x0, LINE_ARRAY_SIZE);  // set line to all zeroes
    }
</pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Close the socket.  Either the client or the server should close the
socket at the end of communication.  Only one needs to do it, and it
doesn't matter which.  In this example, the client does it (see
below).
</p>
</li>

</ol>


<h3>The TCP Client</h3>

<p>
The TCP client goes through three (or four) main steps, as regards the socket.
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>
Create a socket, using the <code>socket()</code> function call:
</p><pre>  socketDescriptor = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (socketDescriptor &lt; 0) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "cannot create socket\n";
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
<code>SOCK_STREAM</code> is a constant that indicates this will be a
TCP (reliable) connection; use <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code> for
(unreliable) UDP communication.  Don't worry about the other
parameters; they never change. 

</li>

<li>
<p>
Connect to the server, using the <code>connect()</code> function:
</p><pre>  serverAddress.sin_family = hostInfo-&gt;h_addrtype;
  memcpy((char *) &amp;serverAddress.sin_addr.s_addr,
         hostInfo-&gt;h_addr_list[0], hostInfo-&gt;h_length);
  serverAddress.sin_port = htons(serverPort);
				
  if (connect(socketDescriptor,
              (struct sockaddr *) &amp;serverAddress,
              sizeof(serverAddress)) &lt; 0) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "cannot connect\n";
    exit(1);
  }
</pre>
Again, don't worry about most of the details.
<code>serverPort</code> is the port that the server is listening on.
The system will assign the client an arbitrary unused port number as
the <q>return address</q>.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Read and write using <code>recv()</code> and <code>send()</code>,
respectively.  This is essentially the same as for the server; see
above.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Close the socket.
</p><pre>  close(socketDescriptor);
</pre>
As mentioned above, it doesn't matter which of the client or server
closes the socket.

</li>

</ol>


<h2 id="java-sockets">Java</h2>

<p>
Here is the source code for the Java examples:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://sage.mc.yu.edu/kbeen/teaching/networking/resources/TCPServer.java">TCPServer.java</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sage.mc.yu.edu/kbeen/teaching/networking/resources/TCPClient.java">TCPClient.java</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>The Server</h3>

<p>
Here are the socket related steps on the server side:
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>
Create a socket for listening for client connection requests on the
port <code>port</code>:
</p><pre>      ServerSocket welcomeSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
</pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Accept client connection, and create a new socket for handling that
connection:
</p><pre>        Socket connectionSocket = welcomeSocket.accept();
</pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Read and write the socket.  This one is a little more involved, but it
is pretty standard Java I/O.  The socket-specific methods are
<code>getInputStream()</code> and <code>getOutputStream()</code> in
the <code>Socket</code> class:
</p><pre>        BufferedReader inFromClient = 
          new BufferedReader
            (new InputStreamReader(connectionSocket.getInputStream()));
        DataOutputStream outToClient =
          new DataOutputStream(connectionSocket.getOutputStream());

        String clientSentence = inFromClient.readLine();
        while (clientSentence != null) {
          System.out.println("  -- " + clientSentence);
          String capitalizedSentence = clientSentence.toUpperCase() + '\n';
          outToClient.writeBytes(capitalizedSentence);
          clientSentence = inFromClient.readLine();
        }
</pre>
Note that the <code>writeBytes()</code> method of the
<code>DataOutputStream</code> method automatically converts Unicode to
ASCII by dropping the high eight bits.  And the
<code>InputStreamReader</code> class handles converting bytes into
(Unicode) characters.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Close the socket.  As with C++, either the client or the server can
close the socket.  In this example, the client does it.
</p>
</li>

</ol>


<h3>The Client</h3>

<p>
Here are the socket related steps on the client side:
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>
Create socket for connecting to host <code>serverHost</code> and port
<code>serverPort</code>:
</p><pre>    Socket clientSocket = new Socket(serverHost, serverPort);
</pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Read and write the socket.  This is similar as for the server; see
discussion above.
</p><pre></pre>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Close the socket:
</p><pre>    clientSocket.close();
</pre>

</li>

</ol>


<h2>Comparison</h2>

<p>
In Java the code is much simpler and cleaner, and there are no
portability problems.  But then, if you are
going to do the assignments in Java, you have to learn Java.  
Java documentation can be found
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/index.html">here</a>.  I
especially find the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/index.html">API
Specification</a> to be useful.
