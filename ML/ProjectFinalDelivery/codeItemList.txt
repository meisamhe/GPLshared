Machine Learning Project pipeline
==========================================
PrjTextExtraction.py => extract text from infographics
lemmatization.py => use the extracted text and lemmatize it
RGBHSVColordCodes.py => extract RGB and HSV of the cod
PrjEMWeka.py => run kmean clustering
dataExtractionkmeanWEka.py => extract result of kmean clustering of weka
PrjDocTermMatrix.py => create a vector of terms in a hash table and then create doc-term matrix, also remove stop words, I also use synonoym set (create doc-doc file)
PrjARFF4FeatureSelection.py => create ARFF file that combines both image and text data of each infographic to run feature selection over it => weka was not so good for this purpose, so I will build this in R (at the end I use the combination, R for matrix multiplication)

Comparison could be based on log likelihood
