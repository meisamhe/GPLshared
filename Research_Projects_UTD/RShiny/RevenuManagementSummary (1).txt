Chapter 3: Revenue Management
Walcak, Boyd, Cramer (02/22/2016)
#----------------------------------------------------
- mathematical modeling in travel industry
- deregulation of airline 1970s (origin)
- 6% increase in airline revenue
- revenue improvement AA: $1 billion (Cook)

Concept: 
#-------------------
- Airlines sell seats by creating different fare classes
- carrying different restrictions and prices
- e.g. unrsitricted Y class fare of $500 and $200 Q class req. Sat night stay and change penalties Seattle to Chicago

- if chose to, make both fare classes available until the flight's departure, or until the plance ran out of seats
- But no need to keep the shelves fully stocked
- Does not need to sell Q, if the predicted demand is 10, and they are expected to purchase more expensive Y

Revenue Management:
--------------------
Practice of determining what fare class should be left on the shelf at any given time

Process of what to leave on the shelf:
----------------------
(1) overbooking
(2) forecasting
(3) optimization
(4) distribution channel
(5) price
(6) other factors

- Effective revenue management: incorporates planning and controls of these dimensions

Early Price Discrim.
-------------------
(1) Ticket for children
(2) Ticket for late night flights (west to east cost): red-eye

Airline distribution
--------------------
-Computerized reservations systems 
-For each flight maintain the number of seats available for sales at each fare class
-Some booked passenger could have not showen up, so overbooking

Deregulation allowed to
-----------------------
-schedule
-price
-manage inventory

(when they saw fit)

Competitive necessity
-----------------------
-How many tickets to make available in each fare class
-Revenue management as survival  skill
-Discounted fare ==> fare products proliferated
-Challange: managing many fare classes
-Reservation systems: kept historical bookings (prediction of future)
-Forecast future booking and cancellation based on historical info => overbooking

Use historical data to determine
---------------------------
- overbooking
- determine the optimal number of seats to set aside in each fare class on each flight
- periodically load the optimal fare class inventory level into an airline's reservation system

Reservation systems managed
---------------------------
- sales of tickets
- recording bookings
- cancellations based on the numbers provided by the revenue management sys.

Revenue management system today
-------------------------------
- tools that connect revenue management analysts with
- airline's most important asset: seat inventory
- sophisticated mathematics embeded
- but require analyst to manage holidays, special events, respond to competitive situation
- review results that fall outside of pre-established bounds

Good revenue management systems take car of
--------------------------------------------
- majority of inventory setting decisions automatically
- freeing analysts to focus their time on the most important flights and markets

Inventory Control
==============================
-Simple: everyone who buys shows up to fly (no cancellation and no-shows)

Nested inventory level
-----------------------
- To avoid purchasing lower class, when higher class is available (more expensive)
- any seats available for lower priced class are also available for higher priced classes
- Overlapping seat availablities
	- Protection level: # seats protected for sale only to a given class and all classes with higher fare value
	- Booking limits: number of seats available for sale to a given class and all classes of lower fare value
- important in environments where reoptimization is performed less frequently
- It is not correct that with frequent reoptimization nested controls are not needed
- Partitioned allocation solves the problem that is different from the real one
- classes higher in a hierarchy are indeed allowed to use allocations of class lower in a hierarchy
- nested controls have better pooling properties
- classes with fares that are close to each other will be treated similarly
- partitioned contrl: produce inferior results when class demand variance is significant and there are many such classes
- For business reasons, not all airlines use purely nested inventory control

Popular method sthat utilize partitioned control
-------------------------------------------------
(1) EMSRa (single control): Expected Marginal Seat Revenue
(2) Probabilistic Nonlinear Program (PNLP)

Seat inventory partition to separate space allocated to
----------------------------------------------------------
- group requests
- Block sales (sales to wholesaler)

- Single class is issued for all legs of multiple flight legs
- Fair class is considered on O&D
- So, booking can have a single class
- The availablity of fare class for all itinerary legs is checked
- Fare class control is fine for airlines with no connecting traffic

Inadequecy of fare class control
------------------------------------
- When an airline's route structure consits of a network of connecting itineraries

Flaws in moder day airline reservation systems
-------------------------------------
- Airline products are defined and priced at one level
- inventory is controlled at another 
=> practical challange for the application of sophisticated mathematical models

Conceptual approaches:
----------------------------------
(1) Leg revenue management
(2) Network revenue management

Leg revenue management
----------------------------------
- flight network consists of a collection of indiv. flight legs
- Demand forecasts are made by leg and fare class
- Demand forecasts by leg and fare class
- fare class booking limits are calculated using an optimization algorithm
- optimization alg. looks at single flight leg
- Simplifies forecasting and optimization
- natural tendency of airline RM analyst: think of seats on flights, and not seats on itineraries
- Dominates in practice
- Difficulty: choice of fare for fare class, ticket with many different fare draw from same leg/fare class
- Fares: important input to inventory alloc. optimization algorithms
- Choice of fare is accomplished by choosing an appropriate "average" fare for each class
- "average" has many different definition here
- Pseudo fare (Mathematical Programming)

Network revenue Management
----------------------------------
- O&D revenue management
- network optimization by dealing directly with the flow of passengers across multiple flight legs
- Not through the use of average fare as leg method do
- two primary method of control dominated in O&D:
	(1) virtual nesting
	(2) bid price control

Virtual Nesting
------------------------------------
- Start by defininng virtual buckets on each leg
- Itinerary/class fares are prorated to indv flight leg in the itinerary
- Each leg component of the itinerary fare is assigned to the appropriate virtual bucket
- Propration is with respect to the itinerary proportion of leg
- Virtual nesting is similar in spirit to leg revenue management 
- same way forecasting and optimization, but using virtual bucket instead of fare classes
- Does not require average fare for each bucket 
- The buckets are defined tightly enough to allow the midpoint fare to be a good point estimate
- Buckets can hold particular range of values
- Itineraries are assigned to buckets based on their value

Bid price Control (Mathematical Programming)
---------------------------------------
- calculate a bid price for each of the flight legs in the network
- An itinerary/fare class is available for sale if its price is at least as large as the sum of the bid prices on the itinerary
- e.g. two leg bids lwer than bid price for the itinerary: $600 >= $200 + $350

Displacement Costs
=============================
- displacement cost of inventory left on hand (cost of displacing passengers)
- Names of displacement cost:
	(1) marginal costs
	(2) marginal revenues
	(3) opportunity costs
	(4) bid prices
- revenue management optimization model assume risk-neutrality and max expected revenue
- Displacement necessary to compare:
	- revenue from the immediate decision (immediate reward from the fare in hand)
	- with the impact that this decision will have on future revenue streams
- Heuristic approach:
	- EMSRB
-Exact solution:
	- dynamic programming
- Complication: displacement cost for a booking request using multiple legs is not necessarily equal to the sum of the displacement costs across the legs

EMSRb (Approximate Dynamic Programming)
--------------------
- estimating it as expected marginal seat revenue from the top nest of classes
- coming on a first-come-first-serve basis (EMSRb) or
- increment of the value function when inventory drops by one unit

Revenue Management and Pricing
=================================
- pricing dep.: create and price fare class products (different products) based on:
	- different products different market segments
	- product features and prices promote upsell
	- what product and prices are offered by competitor
- Revenue Management dep. focus:
	-  what product are actually available for sale at any given time
- Pricing is a strategic activity
- Revenue management is tactical
- Pricing department:
	- stablishes the rules of competitive engagement
- Revenue management department:
	- Manage seat inventory subject to pricing rules
- Two levels of decision making will converge b/c of increased fare transparency:
	- Both to booking customers and
	- competitors
- RM dept. do not change prices
- RM is viewed as performing operational pricing
	- b/c opening and closing fare classes lead to change in the lowest price the customer sees
- Confusion:
	- are faire classes viewed by customer as different products, or simply different prices for the same product

Changing Business Environment
=================================
- Sophisticated algorithm
- underlying mathematical models
- Contextual factors:
	- the growth of internet ticket sales
	- competition from a newe generation of low fare carriers

Low fare carrier
-------------------------
- simplified fare structure
- few or no ticketing restriction
- pricing power
- emulated by Legacy carriers

Internet
-----------------------------
- competitive fares transparent
- analyst can find market fares that a passenger can purchase
- not just fares associated with different fare classes
- but what fare classes are available for sale
- search ticket price tool is idea for revenue management analyst (window shop the competition's prices)
- visibility into what the competition is offering
- New RM model that addresses the new business environment
- incorporation of competitive fare info

Fare matching models (reactive)
-------------------------------
- potential danger
- RM is designed to overcome reactive response to competitive fare
- Avoid straight price matching
- potential to nominally offer competitive fare, but hold back inventory to sell at a higher price after the competitor solds out
- Better management of seat inventory and service

Two important components of revenue management:
--------------------------------
(1) Forecasting
(2) Optimization

Forecasting
================================
- role in RM: provided required inputs to an optimization problem 
- optimization problem: what fare class are available on what flights
- Leg RM use:
	- forecasts at the flight leg/fare class level
	- to produce nested inventory levels
- Forecasting task: (Nested inventory levels)
	- estimate demand in each fare class on each flight leg
- O&D RM requires:
	- much finer level of detail involving customer itineraries
- Earliest models:
	- net demand (expected gross bookings - expected cancellation)
- New optimization requirement:
	- gross bookings
	- cancellations
	- show ups
	- now shows

Bookings, Cancellations, Show ups, No Shows, Overbooking
====================================
- Demand accumulates during the reservation period, or booking cycle 
	- time period to departure during which reservations are accepted
- Reservation periods:
	begin close to a year in advance of the departure date
- New bookings on the day of departure are called:
	- walk ups or go-shows
-other booking and cancellations:
	- no shows
- Hotel and car rental RM terminology:
	- Walk ins: tshow up right before departure 
	- walk ups,  without a reservation
- Airline:
	- No shows- reserved passenger who do not show up without notifying
	- Materialized emand- occupied seat after plan departs (useful for load factor calculation)
- Fly with empty seat b/c of: (spoilage)
	- cancellations
	- no shows
- To avoid spoilage:
	- overbook flights (sell more seats than available expecting some booked passenger will not materialize)
	- some passengers will be denied a seat
- Overbooking algorithm:
	- balance the cost of denying a seat to a passenger (seat on algernative flight with voucher or coupon for future travel)
	- against the opportunity cost of flying with empty seats
- Overbooking limits depend on:
	- booking currently in hand
	- expected new bookings to come
	- expected cancellation
	- expected no-shows and show-ups

Constrained Data
====================================
- fixed capacity
- inventory control throughout a flight's life cycle
=> turned away demand
- booking on hand are almost always biased low
-Booking on hand overestimate true demand if:
	- enough passengers double-book flights (churn in reservation systems)
- attempts to account for churn by:
	- observation building process
	- summarizing PNR data to the level of the forecasting models
- Underestimation of true demand and suboptimal solution if
	- not account for the constrained nature of available bookings
- Setting controls without accounting for constrained nature:
	- results in capturing less potential revenue (spiral-down)
- Solve model specification by:
	- unconstraining
	- product segmentation
- impact of incorrect forecasting and optimization assumption and interplay
	- in the repeated forecast and optimize cycles
- RM model assumptions:
	- fare classes are different products
	- demand arrives independently for each product (simplification)
- Demand is correlated because of external factors such as:
	- availablity
	- seasonality
	- economic trends
	- holiday or special events
- model these effects in forecasting
	- account for most of the dependences
	- even while modeling demand for each class separately
- problem becomes more difficult when:
	- the fare class restrictions or fences are not adequeate to create different products in the mind of consumers
	- when they purchase based on price

Leg Forecasting
========================================
Motivation
-------------------
- Method for determining nested inventory level:
	- Expected marginal seat revenue method, version b EMSRb
- EMSR:
	- assumption that demand arrives in search of a specific fare class (passenger view fare classes as products)
	- only net demand-to-come is required for calculations (no random process of customer type arrival)
- Early forecasting methods:
	- estimate mean and variance of the demand-to-come in each fare class
	- combining forecasts of bookings-to-come, cancellations, show-ups, and no-show
- not always forecast separately
	- but conceptual elements of what went into estimates of the demand-to-come
- Assumption of EMSRb and other early methods (nested inventory level):
	- demand is normally distributed within each leg/fare class
- Dynamic programming (recent):
	- relax both the assumptions in EMSRb
	- much richer demand behavior to be incorporated than passenger arriving in search os specific fare (the product model of demand)
	- the stochastic order in which passengers arrive is modeled explicitly
	- require forecasts of passenger bookings and cancellation rates at different points during booking cycle
	- forecasts may not be limited to individual fare class

Modeling Bookings
=============================================
- data structured for forecasting purposes
- cross-fertilization across airlines
- Discrete data collection points (days): DCP
- DCP defined by the number days prior to the flight's departure
- Number of people booked in a particular fare class by each DCP recorded
- DCP and allocation in the booking cycle: discrete booking curve
- DCP: also called reading point

Airlines forecast:
-----------------
- not just expected number of passengers in a given fare class due on the day of departure
- but the expected number of passengers at different points in the booking cycle
- use historical class-specific bookings
- DOW (day of week) model
- other construction possible:
	- adjacent days strongly correlated: strong trends or high drift

Historical demand representation:
----------------------------------
- tabular
- row: departure date
- column: number of days prior to departure
- data is called snapshot
- called Nevada table, Gillotin, wedge
- x are because the data is collected until some point e.g. 10/16

-For EMSR task is:
	- estimate the bookings-to-come from the last observed data collection point to the day of departure

- For dynamic programming algorithm:
	- forecasts of the arrival rate b/w each DCP
	- One forecast for each empty cell in data guillotin

Utilizing Information from Flights Not yet Departed
===================================================
- forecast methods which place more weight on recent obs and use data from not yet departed flights (incomplete rows) are less sensitive to abnormal departure dates
	- but more sensitive to unusual booking dates
- Forecasts overreact to changes occur along the guillotine edge
-  airline seat sales and promotions often impact all the observations along the guillotine edge (rather than single row or departure date)

Unconstraining
-------------------------
- downward bias of booking for capacity constraints and fare class closures
- Solve problem by unconstraining or detruncating bookings (data imputation)
- Data imputation: replacing constrained or missing data with an estimate of the data that might have been obtained without any constraints in place
- Unconstrained data: basis for forecasting
- Unconstraining method:
	- Expectation Maximization (EM)
- True demand A(d,s) for given fare class from the beginning of the booking cycle 
	- to d days before departure from the flight
	- departure date index s
- Assumed that A(d,s) for fixed d and all date indices s i.i.d. X(s)
- Actual historical observations have been truncated at value c(s)
- E-step:
	- find conditional expectation E[X(s)|X(x) >=c(s)]
- distribution of the X(s) is defined by an initial set of estimates of its defining parameters
	- mean and var of normal distribution
- Constrained value is replaced with the conditional expectation in E-Step
- Revised data is used to find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the distributional parameters
- Max Lik = M-Step
- M-step give rise to a new set of estimates for the parameters defining the distribution of the X(s)
- repeat E-step and M-step until MLE converge
- Under very general conditions, the MLEs converge to the param unknown distrib X(s)
- Once MLEs converge, the truncated observations replaced with their conditional expectations and are considered unconstrained

- to apply EM, tracking when a fare class is opend or closed is required (daily)
- summarize info from daily level to DCP level

Assuming we have unconstrained data
------------------------------------------------
- define A(d,s) as unconstrained booking
- define B(d,s) booking-to come

- independence assumption of CLT violated by time series data (Fuller version)
- simple regression to estimate booking to come
-  Regression model:
	- A(0,s)=a+b.A(d,s)+e
	-e.g. only on known observation in giolltin (d=10)

- Discussed method weights each observation equally 
	=> not capture trend or level changes (recent more relevant)
=> use moving average
- popular model:
	- exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)
	- demand to come framework:
	Bhat(d,s)=a*B(d,s-1)+(1-a)Bhat(d,s-1)=
		a(A(0,s-1)-A(d,s-1))+(1-a)Bhat(d,s-1)

	Bhat(d,s) is estimator of B(d,s)
	0<a<1 is smoothing param

- Other advanced methods:
	Kalman Filtering also possible
	Bayesian Hierarchical also possible
